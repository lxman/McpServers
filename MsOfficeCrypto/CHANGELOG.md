#### Migration Guide
```csharp
// Phase 3 (still works)
var decryptor = DocumentDecryptor.FromFile("file.docx");
byte[] data = decryptor.DecryptDocument("password");

// Phase 4 (recommended)
using var enhancedDecryptor = EnhancedDocumentDecryptor.FromFile("file.docx");
byte[] data = await enhancedDecryptor.DecryptDocumentAsync("password");
```
